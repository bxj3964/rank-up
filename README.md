# Rank Up! - A Persona Social Link Guide
### Origin:
The idea for this project came from my own frustration with needing to keep track of seperate guides for Persona 3-5, rather than having one centralized source. So I decided to solve that problem myself! In the end, I aim for this page to have a design that is interesting as well as inuitive, without the hassle of ads popping up everywhere.
### URL:
https://persona-rank-up.herokuapp.com/
### Current task:
Right now I am working on making the basic framework for the entire website. I want the pages to be able to dynamically load their information from a database, so I am building that out.
### Future goals:
In the future, I want add the ability to create an account and login to the website. After that is created, I want to be able to track which rank the user is on for each social link, so that they can get right back to where they left off.
